This project uses:
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for repeated tasks, because it's installed everywhere and if it ain't broke don't fix it
- [Black](https://github.com/psf/black), uncompromising Python code formatter for codestyle, because life is too short for Pylint
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) because it works
